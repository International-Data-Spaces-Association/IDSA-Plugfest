## What is the IDSA Plugfest?
The IDSA Plugfest Community is a sub-group of the [IDSA Working Group Architecture](https://internationaldataspaces.org/make/working-groups/). As 'Developers' Community' the group deals with all implementation-related aspects of the IDS Architecture.

The [IDS Plugfest Meeting](https://www.dataspaces.fraunhofer.de/en/InternationalDataSpaces/idsa-plugfest.html) is a quarterly event for IDSA members, which takes place since 2018. Before Covid-19, it took place as a physical meeting in the [IDS Lab](https://www.dataspaces.fraunhofer.de/de/InternationalDataSpaces/ids-lab.html) at [Fraunhofer ISST](https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/). Since 2020 it is now a digital event. The meetings are used to connect developers and provide a space to connect with other IDS developers, discuss relevant topics and share experiences as well as fostering integration and interoperability between different IDS components.
